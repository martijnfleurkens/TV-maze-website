## ðŸ“ƒ Explanations

### Vue.js

The choice for Vue.js has been made because of its lightweight framework that is fast and efficient. The possibility to start with a minimal setup made it perfect to create this project within the limited timeframe. As well that the component-based system and flexibility from Vue.js does make it possible to easily expand this project in the feature. Plus it gives the user a great experience because Vue.js is reactive, this way itâ€™s easy to build a real-time application.
Lastly most of my experience with component based frameworks is with Vue.js so it was the best possibility to create this project within the set time.

### Vitest

Vitest is a newer testing framework which connects perfectly to Vue.js because it both runs on development environment Vite and is integrated well. This makes it possible to focus on writing good and high coverage tests and makes it possible to focus less on configuration. Which is perfect in this case because this is a small project. Another benefit is that Vitest is fast compared to similar testing tools. Lastly Vitest is really similar to Jest which a big number of people in the industry use. For the future that would mean it is easy to expand this project and find people who can work with these testing utilities.
